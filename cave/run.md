# HOLD UP!

--- 
**You are exhausted from the continuous running, so your pace is slowed down. Keep up or you'll regret it!**
As you were running, you came across your friend, also running from some creature. You hid in the shadows of the forest and the enormous, dark creature passed by. You are safe . . . for now (: 
Hey, lucky you! You just found an abandoned camping site filled with resources that you need. Unfortunately, you can only carry a certain amount, so choose wisely. 

**_Please select one item that you desire for your journey_**
