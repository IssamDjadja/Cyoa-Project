#A New Barrier
---

 You took the shield! You can use this item for multiple reasons, but be warned that the material used to form this item was worn out. So don't force the object too much.
There was a tunnel that depicted a faint light and a dim flowing current. Where do you want to go?

Float across the [current](current.md)  
Slowly approach the [tunnel](tunnel.md)
