You pryed the door open and you entered before the creature could sense you. You explored around the dark, creepy hallways where you can see faint figures of bodies. Or you could be hallucinating, who knows.  
Windows creeked open, the door that lead to a bedroom began to slam shut and you started to run. You looked around for an exit or a place to stay safe and reach out for assistance. You ran around and panicking, your heart jumped beats and your left leg began to twitch.

You found another door but the locked appeared to be broken. Open the [door](door2.md)
