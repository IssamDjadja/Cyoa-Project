Your friend made the choice and said it's best to stick together to explore this large study room. Suddenly, a swarm of vemonous insects is attracted to your torch. Your friend picked up objects and threw at the swarm, which aggravated them. You have to make sure you and your friend have to stay safe until the end of this cave.  
Do you want to . . .

Keep the torch and attempt to [burn the toxic insects](burnInsects.md)  
[Throw the torch](throwTorch.md) and run
