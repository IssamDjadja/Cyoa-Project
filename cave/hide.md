# Stay Hidden

---

You hide from the insects and they were lost; out of sight. You scanned the area to confirm that the insects were gone completely. You came across a mine cart and unravelled the sheet that covered it. You rode it to safety and got off.  
UH OH! You encountered a beast! What do you do now??
