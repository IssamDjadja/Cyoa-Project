Looking around for about 15 minutes, your friend was no where to be found and you were concerned about your friend's well-being and began to search for her.  
**_Your friend, who blacked out, attacked you because she did not know who was walking towards her_**  
You've been cut on the shoulder with a pocket knife that she found. She began to screech on the top of her lungs and shocked for what she has done. Heavy breaths came in and out; she started apologizing and left you for dead.  
### You bled to death
