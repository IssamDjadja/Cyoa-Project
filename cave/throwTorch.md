# Get Rid of that Torch!

---

You just threw away the torch because it was prior knowledge that the swarm of insects was attracted to the light. You began to run to a safe and secure place where you can rest until the insects are gone.  
Simultaneously, both of you are running low of breath and your trips over a rock because she couldn't see where she was heading to. The insects are just a 13 feet away, what do you do?

THINK FAST!
