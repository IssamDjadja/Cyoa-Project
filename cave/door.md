# The Wooden Door

---

Within a certain distance, you see a wooden door with some room light inside. You and your friend want to go inside to explore and see what you can take for your own safety. 

_You begin to break down the door but the shield broke due to previous use_  
"For God's sake, go find another tool to break the darn door!" your friend uttered with disrespect towards you.  

"Well, I'm SORRY that I've been doing all the work and you've just been following me like an idiot."

"UGH, whatever. I dont even need your help anymore, good bye!"

**As soon as he left, another creature swooped him from the floor and took him away**  

You rapidly search for a tool or weapon to break down the door to enter the building.
