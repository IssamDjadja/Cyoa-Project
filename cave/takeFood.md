#Food Theif
---

#### You took the food and dipped as soon as possible so the creature cannot trail your footsteps

Darn! You fell down a wide sink whole! 
"Where did this come from? We didn't see it as we were running!!!" your friend screamed, "SOMEBODY HELP!"

**You survived for 3 days due to the amount of food you stole**   

_ONE DAY PASSED_  

_SECOND DAY PASSED_  

_THIRD DAY PASSED AND YOUR FOOD IS RUNNING LOW_

"WE ARE GOING TO DIE HERE!" your friend yelled as he paced back and forth.  
Thankfully, there were a few construction workers that passed by and rescued you. You escaped with your friend, but your friend could not maintain his sanity and was put in a mental hospital till he heals.
