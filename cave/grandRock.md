# Safety First! 

---

You reached the Grand Rock and you are in a secure area because the dragon lost sight of you. Thank god, phew! The stranger starts to bicker with you about how you go down the wrong path and you shouldn't be playing around in the cave. You found this absurd and talks back;  
"I'm playing around in the cave? What were you doing??? If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for ME!"  
"You're right, you're right. I apologize. I'm just anxious that we won't be able to leave this horrific cave and maintain my sanity. But look, you're still young. You are a teenager, so make a run for it. I've lived a great life; lost a lot of special things but I'm satisfied with life. I'll distract the dragon. GO!"  
Without being able to stop the stranger, he left you and was a diversion to the dragon. The dragon grasped on the stranger and took him to its nest. He hasn't been seen since then. 

### You signaled the rescue button and you were taken out of the dangerous cave. News had been reported about the perilous cave and was inspected for any other monsters to annihilate.
