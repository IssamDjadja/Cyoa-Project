# Move On

---

You decided to move on from all those memories you had from the cave. You don't want to have to do anything with what happened in the cave with your friend/ stranger.  
_Reporter approaches you_  
"LEAVE ME ALONE! I do not want to speak to you! I will sue for violation of my privacy! Get out of here!" you screamed as loud as you could.  
_Reporter leaves and you lived life to the fullest but you are still scarred from all those memories._  
**You cannot wipe out the memories you had and all the things that you witnessed**
