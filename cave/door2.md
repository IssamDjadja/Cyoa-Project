# Death 

---

You reached the top and someone was there, injured. There were controls that you can use to signal for help. You pushed the button, but later, you noticed you pressed on the wrong button and the lava dragon was attracted to the noise.  
The dragon firebreathed on you, but you dodged. You quickly ran back to the control panel to reach for real help.  
A helicopter flew to the area it received to travel to and took out the dragon.  

"THANK GOD YOU ARE HERE! SAVE US! PLEASE!" you screamed. 

**And to think you are safe and can fly back home, the lava dragon still had strength to pull you down and the helicopter crashed into the giant mountain. **  
You were killed by the lava dragon! Darn it!
