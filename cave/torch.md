# The Light

---

Your friend said to light a torch so you can have a better vision of your path throughout the cave. You look around and discovered that there is a piece of wood lying near a skeleton body and a fresh corpse. Chills went down you and your friend's spine and took the corpse's wool jacket to wrap around the wood and light the torch with the campfire. 

**CHIT, you lit the torch**

Now you can see the majority of the cave and found another cave entrance.
