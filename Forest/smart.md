You are thankful you passed your driver test on your third attempt. With the little energy you have you start the engine with the key that was found already in the car. You feel guilty about taking a car that may have belonged to someone while finding the nearest hospital you encounter. You make it to the hospital in time. The doctor informs you that your leg bone had minor breaks and your other leg didn't loose to much blood, however it got severly infected. You are informed that you must rest for 3-5 weeks and take medication in a moderate fashion.
